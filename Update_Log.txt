Update Log - 2023-03-23 V1.1

1. Added two new global variables - SLIENCE_TIME and SLIENCE_CUT_OUT_TIME:
   - SLIENCE_TIME: Controls the silence duration that triggers the end of recording.
   - SLIENCE_CUT_OUT_TIME: Specifies the time after which SLIENCE_TIME will be multiplied by 0.

2. Updated the condition for stopping the recording based on the new global variables:
   - Modified the if statement in the record_audio function to consider SLIENCE_TIME and SLIENCE_CUT_OUT_TIME.
   - The new approach addresses the issue of infinitely long audio clips by ensuring that the recording stops and creates a new audio file after a certain amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds) to prevent the threshold from being overwhelmed by noise.
   - The implementation effectively limits the maximum recording duration by modifying SLIENCE_TIME based on the SLIENCE_CUT_OUT_TIME value, allowing the system to adapt to varying noise levels and recording conditions.

3. Introduced a new global variable - WHISPER_MODEL:
   - Set the default value to "tiny" and added a comment with available model selections (tiny, base, small, medium, large).
   - Replaced the hardcoded model name in the process_audio_queue function with the new global variable.

4. Created a new global variable - AUDIO_FILE_EXTENSION:
   - Set the default value to ".wav"
   - Replaced the hardcoded file extension in the record_audio function with the new global variable.

5. Removed torchaudio dependency:
   - Torchaudio is no longer used in the program, so it has been removed from the code.
   - Consequently, the installation requirements have been updated, and torchaudio is no longer listed as a required package.

1. Added an option to display or hide processing time:
   - Introduced a new parameter, display_process_time, in the process_audio_queue function.
   - By setting this parameter to True, processing time and speed factor will be displayed for each transcription.
   - To hide the processing time display, set the display_process_time parameter to False.

2. Code refactoring and optimization:
   - Rearranged and restructured code for better organization and readability.
   - Moved local variables that could be used across multiple functions into global variables for easier configuration and maintenance.
   - Optimized performance by removing redundant code and implementing more efficient logic.

3. Updated documentation and comments:
   - Expanded inline comments to provide better context and explanation for code sections.
